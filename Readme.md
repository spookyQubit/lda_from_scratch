In this project, we implement the Latent Diritchlet Allocation (LDA ) for document topic modeling, using collapsed Gibbs sampling, from scratch. The collapsed Gibbs sampling for LDA was introduced by Griffiths et al. in the paper (Finding scientific topics)[http://www.pnas.org/content/101/suppl_1/5228.full.pdf]. 

The major challenge in implementing the model was in trying to rederive the conditional distribution for Gibbs sampling as given in equation 5 of the (paper)[http://www.pnas.org/content/101/suppl_1/5228.full.pdf]. Reading the tutorials by (Carpenter et al)[https://lingpipe.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/lda3.pdf], (Resnik et al.)[https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hardisty/papers/gsfu.pdf] and (Darling)[http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~89-680/darling-lda.pdf] helped me in this process. For my own reference, the derivation can be found in blah.
